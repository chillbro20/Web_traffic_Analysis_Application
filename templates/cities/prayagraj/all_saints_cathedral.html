Also known by the locals as the Patthar Girja, the All Saints Cathedral is a world-famous church located in Prayagraj. As a part of the Gothic revival building built during the British rule in India, this church is modeled after the 13th-century Gothic churches typical of Europe.
<br><br>
Sir William Emerson is credited with the architecture and basic design for this church, which reflects a confluence of Anglo Indian style. It was designed by him in 1871, commenced in 1887, and completed four years later of that date.
