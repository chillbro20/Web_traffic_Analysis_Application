Hanuman Garhi is a 10th century temple of lord Hanuman in Uttar Pradesh, India. Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the
most
important temples in the city along with other temples such as Nageshwar Nath and the in-construction Ram Temple.
Located in the middle of Ayodhya, 76 steps lead to the Hanumangarhi which is one of the most popular temple complexes of
Hanuman in North India. <br><br> It is a custom that before visiting Ram temple one should first pay visit to Lord
Hanuman
temple. The temple houses Hanuman's mother, Anjani, with a young Hanuman sitting on her lap. This shrine is
under the charge of Bairagi Mahants of Ramanandi Sampradaya and Nirvani ani akhara.
